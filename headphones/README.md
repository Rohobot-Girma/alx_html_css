# Headphones Web Page Implementation

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a fully functional web page from scratch using only **HTML and CSS**, following the given Figma design specifications. The goal is to apply knowledge of **HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design** to match the provided UI design.

## Requirements
- **No external CSS frameworks** (e.g., Bootstrap, TailwindCSS)
- **No JavaScript** is allowed
- The design must be pixel-perfect, ensuring it looks identical to the Figma design

## Figma Design
- The design for this project was created by **Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX Designer**.
- To access the design:
  1. Create an account on **Figma** if you don’t have one.
  2. Open the **provided Figma link**.
  3. Click on **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to save it for reference.

## Features & Interactions
- The webpage should adapt to **mobile view (480px or less)**.
- **Hover effects:**
  - Links (`<a>`) hover/active state should be **#FF6565**.
  - Buttons should have **opacity: 0.9** when hovered or clicked.
- **Max content width:** The page content should be **centered and constrained to a maximum width of 1000px**.

- Ensure **text, images, and buttons** match the design specs.

### 3. Responsive Design

- Ensure images and text scale properly.
- Test responsiveness using **Chrome DevTools** or similar tools.

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure proper **color contrast** for readability.
- Use **ARIA roles and labels** where necessary.

## Testing
